# Headless Wordpress

## About WordPress

WordPress’s global content management market share is 64.4%, *even Beyonce* has her website on WordPress.

## CMS (content management system) Architecture

When the front end and back end are used in unison, this is referred to as a coupled *CMS (content management system)*architecture.* This allows everything to be maintained in a single location, such as WordPress, which is perfect for entrepreneurs, bloggers, and business owners.

## Headless Architecture

Using a *“headless” architecture* of the website, the platform’s front end is canceled, leaving only the back end and the API running on the server-side.

Naturally, we will be able to continue creating, changing, uploading, and organizing material in the same way we would if you were using a connected system. 

The main difference is that we will *access our resources using a different front-end solution* referred to as REST API.

WordPress is used as a headless CMS – just for creating and managing your content. The WordPress REST-API allows us to retrieve your content and generate the final HTML. 

# The best of two worlds
